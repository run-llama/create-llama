## Getting Started

Install NodeJS. Preferably v18 using nvm or n.

Inside the `create-llama` directory:

```
npm i -g pnpm ts-node
pnpm install
```

Note: we use pnpm in this repo, which has a lot of the same functionality and CLI options as npm but it does do some things better, like caching.

### Building

When we publish to NPM we will have a [ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) compiled version of the tool. To run the build command, run

```
pnpm run build
```

### Test cases

We are using a set of e2e tests to ensure that the tool works as expected.

We're using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to run the tests.
To install it, call:

```
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
```

Then you can create a global `create-llama` command (used by the e2e tests) that is linked to your local dev environment (if you update the build, you don't need to re-link):

```
pnpm link --global
```

And then finally run the tests:

```
pnpm run e2e
```

To write new test cases write them in [e2e](/e2e)

## Changeset

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing versions and changelogs. To create a new changeset, run:

```
pnpm changeset
```

Please send a descriptive changeset for each PR.

## Publishing (maintainers only)

To publish a new version of the library, first create a new version:

```shell
pnpm new-version
```

If everything looks good, commit the generated files and release the new version:

```shell
pnpm release
git push # push to the main branch
git push --tags
```
