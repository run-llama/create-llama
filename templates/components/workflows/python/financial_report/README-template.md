This is a [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) multi-agents project using [Workflows](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/workflows/).

## Getting Started

First, setup the environment with poetry:

> **_Note:_** This step is not needed if you are using the dev-container.

```shell
poetry install
```

Then check the parameters that have been pre-configured in the `.env` file in this directory.
Make sure you have set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the LLM and the `E2B_API_KEY` for the code interpreter. You can get the E2B API key from [here](https://e2b.dev).

Second, generate the embeddings of the documents in the `./data` directory:

```shell
poetry run generate
```

Third, run the development server:

```shell
poetry run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to start the chat UI.

To start the app optimized for **production**, run:

```
poetry run prod
```

## Configure LLM and Embedding Model

You can configure [LLM model](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/models/llms) and [embedding model](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/models/embeddings) in [settings.py](app/settings.py).

## Use Case

We have prepared an [example workflow](./app/workflow.py) for the financial report use case, where you can ask questions about the example documents in the [./data](./data) directory.

You can start by sending an request on the [chat UI](http://localhost:8000) or you can test the `/api/chat` endpoint with the following curl request:

```
curl --location 'localhost:8000/api/chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Create a report comparing the finances of Apple and Tesla" }] }'
```
