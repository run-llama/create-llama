This is a [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-llama`](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/packages/create-llama).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then check the parameters that have been pre-configured in the `.env` file in this directory.
Make sure you have the `OPENAI_API_KEY` set.

Second, generate the embeddings of the example documents in the `./data` directory:

```
npm run generate
```

Third, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the chat UI.

## Configure LLM and Embedding Model

You can config LLM model and Embedding model in the [settings file](src\app\settings.ts).

## Use Case

We have prepared an [example workflow](./src/app/workflow.ts) for the Deep Research use case, where you can request a detailed answer about the example documents in the [./data](./data) directory.

You can start by sending an request on the [chat UI](http://localhost:3000) or you can test the `/api/chat` endpoint with the following curl request:

```shell
curl --location 'localhost:3000/api/chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Compare the financial performance of Apple and Tesla" }] }'
```
